# React Portfolio

This is a portfolio that has been entirely built using React.js. It displays an about page, contact page and a projects page.

The about page contains a short blurb about myself as a introductory section. The contact page consists of a small form that allows a user to 
submit their name, email address, and a brief message if they would like to submit a message to me. For reference, this submission button does not 
submit the message to me yet as it is morely for show at this point.

Finally, the projects page contains some generic projects I have built over the last several months. A screenshot is included of each project and 
a link to the repo on my Github is also included with each project.

There is also a link to my Github and LinkedIn at the bottom of each page that can also be used to check out those profiles or reach out to me.

Specifically, this uses React v.17.0.2 and makes use of various React elements such as useState hooks, rendering elements to the DOM, and 
event listeners in the form of an onBlur or onSubmit event.

Below is a screenshot of the deployed application.
